This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in PHP when using `unset()` within a `foreach` loop iterating over an array.  The issue stems from how PHP's `foreach` loop internally manages array keys when elements are removed during iteration.  The `bug.php` file shows the unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected approach.  This example highlights the importance of understanding PHP's array handling and the potential pitfalls of modifying arrays in place during iteration.
